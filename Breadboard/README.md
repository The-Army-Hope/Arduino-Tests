# Additional devices
A Breadboard, a resistance, a Button, a LED (we used a red one).
# Infos
If it wasn't clear, this test will make the LED turn on whenever the Button gets pressed.<br>
Both of them are placed on the Breadboard which is connected to the Arduino, connecting the Button and the LED to it too.
